	<p>Your theme contains two page templates for making a layout that has a full width content area and no sidebars. There is a wide template for a page and also a wide template for an individual post.</p>
	<p>There may be times when you want to create a page or a post without any sidebars. This is when you would use the wide template. </p>
	<img style="margin:0 0 0 25px;" src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/includes/template-option-items/tab-content/images/wide-page.png" />
	<p>Normally you can not use a custom template with a post but your theme includes a new function that will allow custom templates that can be applied to an individual post. </p>
	<p>If you look in your post edit page you should see a meta box that has the post templates available to your theme. It most likely will be located below the post content area. But it may appear on the right sidebar area, just depends on your WP installation.</p>
